# Instructions
Below are some instructions on how to get this file into eclipse to view, modify, and run it.

You may have done the first two steps if you bright your own computer and followed the instructions from my previous email.

1: The first is to Install the Java SDK which can be found here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
Download it and install for your OS. I would recommend that you always keep your version of Java up to date.

2: Then I need you to install Eclipse, which can be found here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Please download the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers," it should be the one at the top. If you already have an old version of eclipse or the ee version, that should be fine too. You should really upgrade though if it is old.

3: Take the attached files and unzip them into your eclipse workspace that you set up upon launching eclipse for the first time. This should be in your documents folder. If not, just make a folder in your documents for it. something like... /users/me/eclipse projects/ ... and move the folder "splash" from the zip file into there.

4: Open eclipse, if it gives you a splash screen, find the button that says "workbench" and click it. Then, hit "file" on the top right, go to "import," then under "general" is "existing projects into workspace." click that and navigate to where you unzipped that "splash" folder by clicking browse for  "select root directory"

5: Hit finish, the project will show up on your left. There are two packages, one for the first program I made, and another for the card game.
